## 🎓 My Journey
I'm an Engineering Student at Polytech Dijon, specializing in Cybersecurity. I’m a lifelong learner, taking extra courses in Network and Cybersecurity while honing my entrepreneurial and pitching skills.

## 🔍 Skills & Certifications
I'm currently diving into CCNA and Cybersecurity Analyst certifications. I'm well-versed in network systems and have a solid understanding of Systems Management and Cloud Computing. My true passion? Cybersecurity and Network Management!


## 💻 Projects
- **CCTV Network Simulation Software**: Developed during my internship at ImViA, this tool analyzes camera setups in environments to enhance connectivity and visual coverage.
- **Online Calculator**: Part of a cloud computing project that sharpened my coding skills.
- **Virtual Remote Control for Robotics**: Created a remote control for a Marty-type robot, merging my love for tech with hands-on robotics.
- **Birthday Attack Algorithm**: Explained the Birthday Paradox and how it was used to develop the Birthday Attack algorithm using a website-interface.

## 🌟 What’s Next?
I’m currently enhancing my CCTV network simulation by incorporating secured protocols to prevent breaches and data theft. I'm planning to take the Cisco CyberOps course when time allows.

## 🎯 Goals
- **Short-term**: Secure an internship in Cybersecurity Auditing—I love the diverse challenges it offers.
- **Long-term**: Aim for a role at a major tech company in their Network and Cybersecurity Department while developing my entrepreneurial projects.

## 🚀 Entrepreneurship
I'm currently developing a project called *PrestTeam: The Freelancing of Tomorrow*, a platform designed to encourage teamwork and ease entry into the professional world. Under the guidance of Pépite BFC, I’m working on both the front end and back end, with plans to publish and officially register the company in the near future.
