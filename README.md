## 🎓 My Journey
I'm an Engineering Student at Polytech Dijon, specializing in Cybersecurity. I’m a lifelong learner, taking extra courses in Network and Cybersecurity while honing my entrepreneurial and pitching skills.

## 🔍 Skills & Certifications
I'm currently diving into CCNA and Cybersecurity Analyst certifications. I'm well-versed in network systems and have a solid understanding of Systems Management and Cloud Computing. My true passion? Cybersecurity and Network Management!

## 💻 Projects I'm Proud Of
- **CCTV Network Simulation Software**: Developed during my internship at ImViA, this tool analyzes camera setups in environments to enhance connectivity and visual coverage.
- **Online Calculator**: Part of a cloud computing project that sharpened my coding skills.
- **Virtual Remote Control for Robotics**: Created a remote control for a Marty-type robot, merging my love for tech with hands-on robotics.

## 🌟 What’s Next?
I’m currently enhancing my CCTV network simulation by incorporating secured protocols to prevent breaches and data theft. I'm planning to take the Cisco CyberOps course when time allows.

## 🎯 Goals
- **Short-term**: Secure an internship in Cybersecurity Auditing—I love the diverse challenges it offers.
- **Long-term**: Aim for a role at a major tech company in their Network and Cybersecurity Department while developing my entrepreneurial projects.

## 🏋️ Fun Facts
I may not look it, but I was a daily gym-goer until my senior year of high school! I’d love to find a company that encourages sports among its team members.
I have a Toeic B2 English certificate which is mandatory for Engineering students in France for them to get a diploma at the end of their studies, but I also have a DALF C1 French certificate which I absolutely have no need to in any way whatsoever. I can't even use it to flex on people.
